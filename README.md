This is my first EDA notebook.
 
 In this notebook I used pandas , for data visualization I used matplotlib, seaborn


# Conclusion

After the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, there has been an increase in cases of cancer in Belarus. In general, men have a higher incidence of cancer, especially lung cancer. The largest increase in the incidence in such types of cancer as kidney cancer and cancer of the thyroid. In cities that are closer to Chernobyl, the incidence rate is higher. These regions have high growths in pancreas, thyroid, and skin cancers.

The horrific consequences of the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant once again tell us that humanity must not allow a repetition of such a scenario.
